# Team! (iOS)

### Overview
Team! is an idea I had for an app that focuses around the idea of allowing users in a group share their availability, using the built-in calendar, and find available times for the group to meet. This has started as a summer project with two other friends, one who is building the Android counterpart, and the other mainly focusing on the database. Expected finish date: winter break 2017-2018
